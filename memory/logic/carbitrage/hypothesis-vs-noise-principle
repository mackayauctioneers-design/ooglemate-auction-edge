# Memory: logic/carbitrage/hypothesis-vs-noise-principle
Updated: now

## Core Principle
A profitable one-off sale is never treated as noise to be discarded, but as a hypothesis to be replicated.
Repeatability = confidence. Profitability = relevance. Both matter.
The system must downgrade confidence, not discard intent.

## One-Off Worth Re-Testing Criteria
- sales_count <= 2
- profit >= max(dealer_median_profit × 1.3, $2500)
- buy_price and sale_price both known

## Confidence Levels (Canonical)
- HIGH: ≥5 sales AND spec_completeness ≥3
- MEDIUM: 3-4 sales OR mixed specs (never HIGH if specs incomplete)
- LOW: 1-2 sales — always LOW, never discarded

## Fingerprint Types
- Core (sales_count ≥ 3, positive profit): "Actively hunt these vehicles"
- Outcome (sales_count 1-2, above threshold): "Worth re-testing — buy one more to validate"

## UI Actions (Non-Negotiable)
Every vehicle insight must have at least one action button:
- Search current listings
- Watch for similar vehicles / Add to sourcing list
No dead insights. Ever.

## Page Sections (Locked)
1. Proven Repeatable Winners — "You can actively hunt these with confidence"
2. Profitable One-Offs (Worth Re-Testing) — "Low confidence — but absolutely worth trying again"
3. What You Should Be Watching — unified sourcing list (core=hunt, outcome=watch)
