# Memory: logic/carbitrage/fingerprint-dual-type-system-v1
Updated: now

The fingerprint system now supports TWO types of target candidates:

## Type A — Core Fingerprints
- Built from 3+ sales of the same vehicle shape
- Confidence: medium or high (based on sales_count)
- Full scoring (0-110): repeatability + velocity + profitability + consistency + bonus/penalty
- Always-on scanning, primary hunting targets

## Type B — Outcome Fingerprints (NEW)
- Built from 1-2 PROFITABLE sales of a vehicle shape
- Confidence: low
- Simplified scoring (0-50): outcome signal + velocity + margin quality
- Purpose: remember what worked, watch for repeats, catch forgotten winners
- Must NOT be auto-retired or filtered by volume gates
- outcome_verified = true

## Key Principle
- Eligibility = did this make money? (profit_pct > 0)
- Confidence = how often did it happen? (sales_count)
- These are SEPARATE fields, never conflated

## Database Fields (sales_target_candidates)
- fingerprint_type: 'core' | 'outcome'
- confidence_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
- outcome_verified: boolean

## Daily Target Generation
- Core targets get ~80% of daily slots
- Outcome targets get 2-3 discovery slots per day
- Both types respect the 7-day rotation guard

## UI Labels
- Core → "Repeatable" (blue badge)
- Outcome → "Outcome" (purple badge with eye icon)
- Outcome cards show: "Profitable singleton — watch & re-test if found again"
