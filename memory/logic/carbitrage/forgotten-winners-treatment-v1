# Memory: logic/carbitrage/forgotten-winners-treatment-v1
Updated: now

## Core Principle
A profitable one-off is not noise — it is a hypothesis.
Repeatability = confidence. Profitability = relevance. Both matter.

## Detection Logic
A sale qualifies as "worth re-testing" if:
- sales_count <= 2 for that make/model
- profit >= max(dealer_median_profit × 1.3, $2500)
- buy_price and sale_price are both known

## Response Buckets
Bob always returns THREE buckets for forgotten-winners intent:
1. True one-offs (N=1) — hypothesis-grade
2. Near one-offs (N=2) — emerging signal
3. Why they matter + how to treat them

## Treatment Rules
- Do NOT scale immediately
- Do NOT ignore
- Treat the next purchase as a test trade, not a strategy
- Include concrete sourcing instruction with KM/price ceiling
- "If you repeat the outcome once more, this moves from signal → strategy"

## Forbidden Behaviour
- Bob must NEVER say "you don't have any" and stop
- Bob must NEVER discard profitable one-offs due to low volume
- Bob must ALWAYS explain how to treat what exists
