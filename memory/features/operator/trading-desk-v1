Updated: now

The 'Trading Desk' (/operator/trading-desk) is the centralised multi-dealer opportunity blotter. It scores ALL candidate listings (vehicle_listings + shadow) against ALL accounts' fingerprints in vehicle_sales_truth, producing a ranked global view.

## Schema
- Table: `operator_opportunities` with multi-account scoring columns (best_account, alt_matches JSONB, tier, status)
- Unique on `listing_id` for idempotent upserts

## Scoring Engine
- Edge function: `score-operator-opportunities` (runs every 30 min)
- Intake thresholds (loosened): under_buy >= -$500 for WATCH, >= $1,500 for BUY/HIGH/CODE_RED
- Tiering: CODE_RED (margin >= $6k + under_buy >= $1.5k), HIGH (>= $4k), BUY (>= $1.5k under_buy), WATCH (rest)
- Each listing scored against ALL accounts; best margin determines best_account; others stored in alt_matches

## UI
- Filters: Account, Tier, Source, Status, Min Margin
- Actions: Assign to specific dealer, Buy, Ignore, external link
- KPI cards: CODE_RED, HIGH, BUY, WATCH counts
- Defaults to 'New + Reviewed' status view, sorted by margin DESC

## Operator-Only
- Protected by OperatorGuard
- RLS: admin role only via has_role()
