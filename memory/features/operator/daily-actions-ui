# Memory: features/operator/daily-actions-ui
Updated: now

The Operator Dashboard (/operator) includes a 'TodayActionsCard' component powered by the 'get_today_actions()' RPC. It displays:

SECTIONS:
- URGENT (red): Stale BUY_WINDOW (36h+), Overdue VA tasks
- ACTIONS: Unassigned BUY_WINDOW, VA tasks due (24h), Traps pending validation
- LEARNING: Missed Buy Windows (7d)
- TOP PRIORITY: Single highlighted vehicle callout with details

DISPLAY RULES:
- Polls every 60 seconds
- Red border when urgent items exist
- 'All caught up' state when nothing pending
- Links directly to relevant pages

This drives daily operator focus without manual searching.
