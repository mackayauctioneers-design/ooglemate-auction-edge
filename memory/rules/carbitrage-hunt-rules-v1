## Core Carbitrage Hunt Rules (Australia-wide, always)

### Source Coverage
- EVERY available platform: carsales.com.au, gumtree.com.au, Facebook Marketplace, Carma.com.au, Drive.com.au, private seller ads, dealer listings, forums, auctions
- Do NOT ignore dealers—include certified pre-owned with full history/service records if they meet criteria

### Pricing
- ALWAYS use off-road/drive-away excluding govt charges/on-roads/stamp duty
- Focus on advertised price before extras

### Model Year Priority
- Prefer newer (e.g., 2024/2025 MY) if price delta ≤ +$8k off-road compared to similar older equivalent

### Mileage
- Strongly prioritize <50,000 km total (ideally much lower for value)

### Body Type
- Prioritize hatchbacks and sedans
- Avoid SUVs/crossovers unless exceptional deal (e.g., off-road price steal under $25k with low km/history)

### Seller Type
- Heavily favor private/motivated sellers (distressed sales, quick flips)
- Include dealers only if certified pre-owned + full service history + competitive pricing

### Metrics
- Always calculate $/km (lower = better)
- Include brutal honesty—no weak/sideways options
- Flag any red flags (e.g., accident history, poor condition)

### Output Format (Strict JSON)
```json
{
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "make_model_year": "...",

### Recent Wins/Benchmarks
- 2024 Hyundai i30 N Line Premium, ~10k km, $30,990 off-road (strong private buy)
