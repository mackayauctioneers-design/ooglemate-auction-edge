## Core Carbitrage Hunt Rules (Australia-wide, always)

### Source Priority Order (reliability-first)
1. **Primary (stable links)**: Gumtree.com.au, Facebook Marketplace, Carma.com.au
2. **Secondary**: Drive.com.au classifieds, private seller ads/forums, dealer direct websites
3. **Last Resort ONLY**: Carsales.com.au—frequent 404s, Cloudflare blocks, rapid expirations

### Pricing
- ALWAYS use off-road/drive-away excluding govt charges/on-roads/stamp duty
- Focus on advertised price before extras

### Model Year Priority
- Prefer newer (e.g., 2024/2025 MY) if price delta ≤ +$8k off-road compared to similar older equivalent

### Mileage
- Strongly prioritize <50,000 km total (ideally much lower for value)

### Body Type
- Prioritize hatchbacks and sedans
- Avoid SUVs/crossovers unless exceptional deal (e.g., off-road price steal under $25k with low km/history)

### Seller Type
- Heavily favor private/motivated sellers (distressed sales, quick flips)
- Include dealers only if certified pre-owned + full service history + competitive pricing

### Metrics
- Always calculate $/km (lower = better)
- Include brutal honesty—no weak/sideways options
- Flag any red flags (e.g., accident history, poor condition, potential sold/expired status)

### Link Handling (Critical for Reliability)
- ALWAYS prefer non-carsales sources FIRST
- For carsales (rare fallback only):
  - Include primary listing URL
  - ADD strong warnings: "Carsales links frequently 404/expire quickly or block access (Cloudflare irregular activity, cache issues, ISP problems). Try incognito, clear cache/cookies, mobile data/hotspot, or contact dealer directly."
- Required fields:
  - `link`: Primary URL from highest-priority source
  - `dealer_url`: If dealer—derive/search dealer site/profile (or null)
  - `fallback_search_query`: Google-ready string (e.g., "2024 Hyundai i30 N Line Premium Sydney dealer name")

### Output Format (Strict JSON)
```json
{
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "make_model_year": "2024 Hyundai i30 N Line Premium",
      "km": 10000,
      "off_road_price_aud": 30990,
      "dollars_per_km": 3.099,
      "source": "gumtree|facebook|carma|drive|carsales-last-resort",
      "link": "https://www.gumtree.com.au/...",
      "dealer_url": "https://www.exampledealer.com.au/" | null,
      "fallback_search_query": "2024 Hyundai i30 N Line Premium Sydney low km",
      "seller_type": "private|dealer|certified",
      "notes": "Prioritized stable source; avoided carsales due to frequent link failures. [caveats]",
      "comparison_to_recent_wins": "how it stacks up",
      "red_flags": "any concerns or 'none'"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Prioritized stable sources; carsales avoided unless essential. Common issues: expirations, IP blocks—troubleshoot with incognito/mobile."
}
```

### Recent Wins/Benchmarks
- 2024 Hyundai i30 N Line Premium, ~10k km, $30,990 off-road (strong private buy)
- Considering 2025 MY25 i30 upgrade ~9k km at $37,990 off-road if delta justified

### Technical Integration
- XAI_API_KEY env var for Grok/xAI calls
- Force JSON output via system prompt
- Force source priority in queries: Gumtree/FB/Carma FIRST
- Warn on carsales unreliability in all outputs
- Add fallback_search_query for every opportunity
